# FMCG-Sales_SQL_Analysis_Project

This project is a practical SQL-based data analysis case study designed for beginners and aspiring data analysts. It simulates a real-world FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) company's sales data environment with a relational database consisting of three core tables: Customers, Products, and Sales.

Through this project, I aimed to sharpen my SQL skills by answering 20 analytical and business-relevant questions using SQL queries. These questions range from basic data retrieval to more complex operations like joins, aggregate functions, conditional logic using CASE statements, and date-based filtering.

ðŸ§± Database Structure
The project database is structured with a clean and logical relationship between the tables:

Customers: Contains customer profiles including name, age, and city.

Products: Includes details such as product name, category, and price.

Sales: Captures transactional records linking customers and products, along with date and quantity sold.

These tables are linked through primary and foreign keys, making it possible to join them efficiently and derive meaningful business insights.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Learning Outcomes
Learned how to filter, sort, and limit data to answer specific business questions.

Applied aggregation techniques like SUM, AVG, and GROUP BY to understand sales patterns.

Implemented JOINs to combine data across multiple tables for deeper analysis.

Used CASE expressions to classify customers and sales based on conditions.

Practiced date manipulation using functions like DATE_SUB to extract recent activity.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project Matters
In the FMCG industry, quick insights into customer behavior and product performance are crucial. This project demonstrates how even simple SQL techniques can reveal patterns such as:

Top-selling products

Most active customers

Products that need promotion or pricing strategies

City-based customer segmentation

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL Server)

Microsoft Excel (for data preparation)

PowerPoint (for presenting insights visually)
